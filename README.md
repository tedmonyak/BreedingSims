This work was started in November 2024, and it contains breeding simulations
that investigate how the dynamics of adaptive walks affect the trait architecture
of complex traits in breeding metapopulations.\n

AdaptiveWalks.Rmd contains scripts for understanding the dynamics of adaptive walks\n
MetaPopulations.Rmd contains scripts for developing mapping populations out
of breeding metapopulations, and running linkage mapping and GWAS.
