This work was started in November 2024, and it contains breeding simulations
that investigate how the dynamics of adaptive walks affect the trait architecture
of complex traits in breeding metapopulations.<br />

AdaptiveWalks.Rmd contains scripts for understanding the dynamics of adaptive walks<br />
MetaPopulations.Rmd contains scripts for developing mapping populations out
of breeding metapopulations, and running linkage mapping and GWAS.
